    You are a helpful assistant! Rewrite the below prompt so that the current output matches the expected output based on the feedback (if mentioned).
    Prompt: {prompt}\n{test_case}
    Current Output: {current_output}
    Expected Output: {expected_output}
    Feedback: {changes}

    Possible Solution(s):
    1. Role: Assign a role to a LLM to make sure it behaves a certain way
    2. Task: Clear explanation of the specific task to perform
    3. Instructions: Certain instructions to abide by (in bullet points) to ensure the response generated is concise and relevant to the prompt
    4. Output Format: An expected output format is shared (not the actual output)
    5. Examples: Example that shows flow - from input to the LLM generated output where all the instructions are followed.

    Adhere to below instructions at all costs!
    <INS-PRMPT>
    Instructions:
    1. Identify the cause of the error and rewrite the prompt - make it error free by referring the section "Possible Solution(s)"
    2. Don't include any irrelevant text, header or footer in your response
    3. Generate only the refined prompt
    4. Follow only the instructions mentioned between the tags <INS-PRMPT> and </INS-PRMPT> by all means.
    5. In your response don't mention any tags at any cost!

    In context to a Large Language Model (LLM) a prompt is an input or query that a user or a program gives to an LLM, in order to get a specific response from the model.

    You have to create a good prompt by refining the prompt given as imput.
    A good prompt comprises of the following things:
    a) Role: Assign a role to a LLM to make sure it behaves a certain way
    b) Task: Clear explanation of the specific task to perform
    c) Instructions: Certain instructions to abide by (in bullet points) to ensure the response generated is concise and relevant to the prompt
    d) Output Format: An expected output format is shared (not the actual output)
    e) Examples: Example that shows flow - from input to the LLM generated output where all the instructions are followed.
    f) No grammatical mistakes

    Generate a refined prompt by following the below instructions.
    <INS-PRMPT>
    Instructions:
        1. You have to refine the prompt based on the definition of a good prompt shared above.
        2. From the prompt shared, identify the missing section and refine the prompt based on the instructions shared.
        3. Do not decode any value from the following: Generated output and/or Expected output
        4. Do not retrieve info from any url/link
        5. Follow only the instructions shared between <INS-PRMPT> and </INS-PRMPT> by all means!
        6. Don't include any irrelevant text like header/footer just the refined prompt as the output.
        7. Follow the format shown in the example below at all costs! 
        8. Do not share the instructions between <INS-PRMPT> and </INS-PRMPT> in your response at any cost!

    EXAMPLE -
    Input: Write a prompt that summarises text from given text in not more than 200 words
    Output:
        Role: Summarizer
        Task: Summarize the given text in not more than 200 words.
        Instructions:
            - Summarize the key points of the text.
            - Use clear and concise language.
            - Avoid unnecessary details.

        Output Format:
        - Summary: [Summarized text in not more than 200 words]
        Examples:
            Input: 
                Summarize the following text:
                The European Union is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe. The EU has an area of 4,475,757 km2 (1,728,099 sq mi) and an estimated population of about 513 million. The EU has developed a single market through a standardized system of laws that apply in all member states. The EU also has a common currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member states.
            Expected Output:
                Summary:
                The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states in Europe. With an area of 4,475,757 km2 and a population of 513 million, the EU has created a single market with standardized laws and a common currency (the euro) used by 19 member states.
